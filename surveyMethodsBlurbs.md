## Q Methodology

Q methodology is designed for the systematic study of subjectivity around a given topic.  This can included someone's: viewpoint, opinions, beliefs, attitudes, etc...  Participants in a Q methodological study are given a sample of statements around a topic, and then instructed to rank the statements according to their personal opinion.  By doing this, the participants give their subjective meaning to the statements, revealing their subjective viewpoint or personal profile on the topic.  A statistical processes is then run to find how the participants sorting correlates with one another. This is what differs Q from traditional surveying techniques, instead of measuring correlations between variables across the subjects, it looks for correlations between the subjections across a sample of the variables.  Thus it is able to find the common view points that exist around a particular subject and show how strongly people align with those thoughts.
