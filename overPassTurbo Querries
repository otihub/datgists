# Useful Querries for Using Overpass-Turbo to Retreive OSM Data

## Background

[Overpass-Turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) is a great website for extract data from OSM.  You can save it as a geoJSON, KML, load it into JOSM, or even export it straight to a GIST!  The site has a built in wizard to make querrying data super easy, but this GIST will include some basic querries that go beyond.


## Querries

### Filter based on a country or other geography
This querry is looking for all attributes marked as historic but only in Lebanon.  You can swich lebanon for a different geography (anything in OSM's geocoder Nominatim) 

```
/*
This has been generated by the overpass-turbo wizard.
The original search was:
“amenity=place_of_worship in Lebanon”
*/
[out:json][timeout:25];
// fetch area “Lebanon” to search in
{{geocodeArea:Lebanon}}->.SafyArea;
// gather results
(
  // query part for: “amenity=place_of_worship”
  node
    ["historic"](area.SafyArea);
);
// print results
out body;
>;
out skel qt;
```
