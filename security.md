# IT Security

**[disclaimer]**  
If you feel the data your program maintains is at risk from adversarial actors and that having your systems compromised will put the program, your partners or yourselves at risk that we highly recommend bringing in professional security consultant to assist.

Nevertheless there are a few things that require very little investment and can go a long way toward improving your security posture.

## Use a Password Manager
Our digital lives routinely has us bumping up against the upper limit of passwords we can keep memorized. Often time people end up compromising their security by making common password mistakes including:
+ Using the same password across multiple platforms
+ Creating weak passwords
+ Writing all their passwords down in one place that is easily accessible

A simple solution to these problems is using a **password manager**.

A  **password manager** is software that saves all your passwords in one encrypted database, they often also help you to create robust passwords. These software allow you to have one password to rule them all and can help alleviate the problems that lead to poor password management.

There are a number of password management software available depending on your platform.
Follow the [link](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-password-managers,review-3785.html) for a list of available options.

## Enable two-factor authentication
Passwords alone are no longer sufficient. Two factor auth is when on-line services make you verify your identity before logging in, either by sending you a message or by making you enter a code from a separate app like [authy](https://www.authy.com/). Use two factor auth wherever possible but especially in your primary email account.

## Browse the web safely

### Beware of short links
Short links obscure the full url to which you are navigating. Disguising malicious links in this manner is a common tactic used to get people to download malicious software.

### Practice mindful posting
Personal on-line profiles are often a useful vector for adversaries to trace.
+ Be wary of posting locations, specifics dates, home addresses etc.
+ Consider maintaining separate on-line personas to divide personal and work lives.

### Remove cookies  
it is safe to say that unless you are taking steps to mitigate it, if you are browsing the web, you are being tracked. Many if not most websites you visit automatically place files on your browser expressly for this purpose. Most of the time cookies are placed on your computer by advertisers or simply by websites to create a more seamless browsing experience - for instance by remembering information you entered when you navigate away. Cookies can also be used by  adversaries to monitor your behavior online so it is best to disrupt them. [Privacy Badger](https://www.ublock.org/) can help with this.

### Use an ad blocker
Adds can be used to deliver malware plus who wants to see that anyways, Use a browser extension like [uBlock origin](https://www.ublock.org/) to get rid of them.
### Occasionally scan for malware
## Encrypt everything
### Phone
 + *iPhone* - newer ones are encrypted by default
 + *Android* - Most need to have encryption turned on.

### Hard drive
 + Mac - FileVault
 + Windows - Bitlocker

### Turn off devices at critical junctures
Make sure that your device is powered off before you pass through borders and other high security areas. In order to take advantage of full disk encryption your device needs to be off and high security areas are where you are most likely to have a device confiscated and searched.

### Messaging
A lot of programs are using [WhatsApp](https://web.whatsapp.com/%F0%9F%8C%90/en) for encrypted communication. [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) is marginally better for security but WhatsApp uses similar encryption but there are a few things that can be done to improve security on WhatsApp.   
#### Turn off cloud backup####
*iPhone*  
    Step 1: WhatsApp settings > Chats > Chat Backup > Auto Backup > Off  
    Step 2: Exit WhatsApp, navigate to System Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage storage > WhatsApp > Backup  
 *Android*   
Menu > Settings > Chats > Chat Backup > Backup on Google Drive > Never

#### Change security settings ####
Consider changing settings so that only your contacts can see when you are online   
*iPhone* Settings > Account > Privacy   
*Android* Menu > Settings > Account > Privacy

#### Use session verification ####
For particularly sensitive conversations you can turn this feature on. Session verification will generate a unique code that you and your conversation partner can see. If the codes match you can be sure that the message hasnt been intercepted by a third party.
*iPhone* Click on partners name > Encryption >
*Android* Menu > View Contact > Encryption
