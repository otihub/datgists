# DAT Gist Repo

## Intro
Gists are awesome! They help unlock knowledge siloed with individual team members and share it with colleagues. As a shared repository of team knowledge, it will create a more open and transparent operating environment. 

Going on a TDY and need someone to cover a project for you? Refer them to a gist!  Got food poisoning from Auntie B's tuna-casserole and won't be in the office for a while? Tell the person covering you to use a gist you wrote.  Someone always asking you how did you do that in ArcGIS?  Tell them to follow the gist!  This way we can continue providing the high level of support and products we have without skipping a beat!

A Gist should be focused on one of two subjects, explaining how to:
  - Create a specific product ( e.g. How to make the Monthly Program Map for Country XXX)
  - How to preform a specific task or processes (How to do the *DAT Monthly Update* or how to use gdal to convert a csv to a shapefile) 

Please review the *[Quick Start/Best Practices Gist](https://github.com/otihub/datgists/blob/master/quickStartBestPractices.md)* before contributing to the team's Gist repo and when you add a new one, update the gist index.

## Disclosure
Since these are public gists please make sure to scrape all:
- PII
- Filepaths to datasets
- Specific program names
- Any other sensitive information or materials
