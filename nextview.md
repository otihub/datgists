## Getting Imagery
- USAID/Geocenter has an process detailed [here](http://geocenterusaid.org/RSwebpage/index.html) for one off imagery requests
- For routine use access to Digital Globes Earth View Web Hosting System (EVWHS) is more efficient. This might take some negotiation with NGA and Geocenter but DAT can help!
